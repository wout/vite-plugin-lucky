# Vite Plugin Lucky

A plugin to make [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) play nice with [Lucky Framework](https://github.com/luckyframework/lucky).

## Introduction

This plugin was developed to integrate Vite with Lucky as seamlessly as possible. It respects the folder structure of Lucky and comes with defaults that align with Lucky's. It's meant to be used with the [lucky_vite](https://github.com/wout/lucky_vite) Crystal shard.
